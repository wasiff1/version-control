git branches
============
In project multiple teams will be involved 
CR Teams , prod Teams , Enhancement Team , R & D Team

=> When multiple Teams are working paralelly code integration becomes difficult.

=> In every repository below branches might be available
1) main/master
2) develop
3) feature
4) research
5) staging
6) release

=> Every Teams should have separate code base for easy maintenence

=> Under one repository multiple branches will be created and using branches multiple teams can work paralelly.

=> We clone git repo using clone command (it will clone default branch) 

=>  git checkout <branch  name> - to change branch or switch from one branch to another
============================

=> We can clone particular branch code also using below command
 git clone -b  <branch name> <repo-url>

=> We can check out working tree pointing to which branch using
git branch

pull request (PR) => pull request is used to merge changes from one branch to another
===========
