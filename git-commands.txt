git init => To initialize the empty git repository.
git ignorefile  => whatever mentioned in git ignore file will not be committed 
========
git help => To get the most frequently used git command
=======
git config => Used to configure user details with git bash.
=======
git add =>  Used to add files in staging area.
=======
git status => To check which files are added to staging area or not
=========
git commit => It used to commit the files from staging area to local repository.
=========
git remote add => To add the remote repository url to our working tree
=========
git push => It used to send the changes from local repository to remote repo
========
git clone => It used to download the complete project from remote reposotory to our local
=========
git restore => Used to unstage the file and discard the changes 
========
git log => Used to check the commit history
=======
git rm => Used to remove the file from remote repository (after git rm we need to commit and push that remove)
======
git revert => Used to uncommit the changes (after git revert we need to commit and push)
======
git pull => Used to download the latest changes from remote repo to local
=======
merge conflict => When the changes are on the same file same line then there is chances of getting merge conflict
=============  when we do git pull then there is chances of getting merge conflict.
Then we need to resolve merge conflict and then we need to push after removing jargon code generated during conflict


git branches
============
In project multiple teams will be involved 
CR Teams , prod Teams , Enhancement Team , R & D Team

=> When multiple Teams are working paralelly code integration becomes difficult.

=> In every repository below branches might be available
1) main/master
2) develop
3) feature
4) research
5) staging
6) release

=> Every Teams should have separate code base for easy maintenence

=> Under one repository multiple branches will be created and using branches multiple teams can work paralelly.

=> We clone git repo using clone command (it will clone default branch) 

=>  git checkout <branch  name> - to change branch or switch from one branch to another
============================

=> We can clone particular branch code also using below command
 git clone -b  <branch name> <repo-url>

=> We can check out working tree pointing to which branch using
git branch

pull request (PR) => pull request is used to merge changes from one branch to another
===========

git pull vs git fetch
=====================
git fetch => is used donwload the latest changes from remote to local repository but changes will bring to working tree
Working Tree =>  means your working code or current branch

--------------------------------------------------
| Aspect               | git fetch | git pull |
| -------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| Downloads changes    | ✅         | ✅        |
| Updates local branch | ❌         | ✅        |
| Risk of conflicts    | ❌         | ✅        |
| Safe for review      | ✅         | ❌        |
| One-step command     | ❌         | ✅        |

git merge => to merge changes from one branches to another branch  + maintaining the commit history also

git rebase => to merge changes from one branches to another branch.not maintain commit history

git stash  =>git stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes.
=========
git stash apply => Bring back stash (but keep it)

git diff => git diff shows the difference between changes in your code — what’s added, removed, or modified.
👉 Think: “What exactly did I change?”

git tag => Git tag marks a specific commit with a name (usually a release).
Used for versioning, releases, and milestones.
Tags are immutable (don’t move like branches).
